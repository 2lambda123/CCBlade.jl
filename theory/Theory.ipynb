    "The basic blade element momentum theory works well for on-design operation and is detailed in many references.  For the standard case, the author has developed a reformulated approach that simplifies the solution processes and is provably convergent \\cite{Ning2014-Simple-Solution}.  However, when considering operation under turbulent conditions, gusts, maneuvers, with flexible blades, and in other non-ideal operating scenarios, a more complete derivation is needed.  In this derivation we extend basic blade element momentum theory to consider all possible inflow angles, large axial inductions, turbines and propellers simultaneously, and yawed inflow."

The x and y axis are defined so that the z-axis is out of the page towards the direction of the blade tip.  We consider a general inflow of $V_x$ and $V_y$.  For ideal conditions $V_x = V_\\infty$, and $V_y = \\Omega r$, but because of wind and blade motion, we allow for any general velocity vectors.  Generally, this is accomplished by using a direction cosine matrix to define the 3D orientation and to take relative (wind/structural) velocities.\n",

For example, $V_x$ creates a force to the right, and thus an induced velocity to the left adding to that of $V_y$.  Conversely, $V_y$ creates a force upward, and thus an induced velocity downward opposing $V_x$.  As discussed previously, we normalize these induced velocities as follows: $a = u/V_x$ and $a^\\prime = v/V_y$, where $u$ and $v$ are the x- and y-components of induced velocity respectively.  The resulting total inflow velocity vector $W$, positive direction for the inflow angle $\\phi$, and angle of attack $\\alpha$ are shown below.\n",
