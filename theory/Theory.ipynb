    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic blade element momentum theory works well for on-design operation and is detailed in many references.  For the standard case, the author has developed a reformulated approach that simplifies the solution processes and is provably convergent \\cite{Ning2014-Simple-Solution}.  However, when considering operation under turbulent conditions, gusts, maneuvers, with flexible blades, and in other non-ideal operating scenarios, a more complete derivation is needed.  In this derivation we extend basic blade element momentum theory to consider all possible inflow angles, large axial inductions, turbines and propellers simultaneously, and yawed inflow."

    "We begin simply by applying mass and momentum balances for a streamtube passing through a rotor.  Rather than using one streamtube for the entire rotor disk, we use an annulus streamtube passing through a specific location of $r$ along the rotor (see figure below). This will allow for higher accuracy when relating to blade element theory later.  Through most of the document we will use the conventions for wind turbines, but the theory is equally applicable to propellers/fans as well.  The small modifications necessary for propellers are discussed throughout.  We will use the term propellers to generically refer to any turbomachine that adds momentum to the fluid.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, let's perform a mass balance.  In the following derivation we neglect any variations in density.  For a wind turbines an incompressibility assumption is reasonable, but for high-speed propellers some compressibility corrections may be necessary.  For the velocity upstream we will use $V_x$ rather than $V_\\infty$ to match the convention used later in blade element theory.\n",

    "\n",
    "Extensions and modifications applicable to momentum theory include: hub and tip losses, high induction factors, off-design wind directions, and propeller operation.  Each of these considerations is discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hub and Tip Losses\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic momentum theory ignores the hub and tip vortices that affect the induced velocity.  Various correct methods exist; we use the simple analytical expression developed by Prandtl\\cite{Glauert1935-Airplane-Propellers}.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    f_{tip} &= \\frac{B}{2} \\left(\\frac{R - r}{r|\\sin\\phi|} \\right)\\\\\n",
    "    F_{tip} &= \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\arccos(\\exp(-f_{tip}))\\\\\n",

    "    F &= F_{tip}F_{hub}\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The absolute value is necessary because our definition permits both positive and negative inflow angles.  This hub/tip-loss factor (which is always between 0 and 1) is applied directly to the thrust coefficient.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    C_T = 4 a (1 - a) F\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High Induction Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical data suggests that this simple momentum model breaks down for large inductions.  The current expression for thrust coefficient (\\cref{eq:CTmom2}) predicts a maximum at $a = 0.5$ as seen in \\cref{fig:a}.  Additionally, this basic momentum derivation predicts a wake reversal in the far-field for axial induction factors larger than 0.5 (see \\cref{eq:V4}).  This is non-physical, as the real flow entrains momentum in the wake through turbulence.  Empirical data suggests that the thrust coefficient continues to increase past induction factors of 0.5, all the way up to an axial induction factor of 1 (\\cref{fig:a}).  Various simple extension methods exist, including the well-known quadratic fit from Glauert \\cite{Glauert1926-General-Theory}.  However, the Glauert correction does not maintain C1 continuity when the tip/hub loss corrections are included.  Instead, we use a small modification of Glauert's method developed by Buhl \\cite{Buhl2005-Empirical-Relationship}:\n",

    "Additional considerations are needed for induction factors larger than 1, the so-called propeller brake region.  The current expression \\cref{eq:CTmom2} predicts a negative thrust for induction factors larger than 1 (in other words, propeller operation).  However, repeating the momentum conservation, suggests that the thrust changes signs, in other words it still acts as a drag device.\n",

    "#### Other Wind Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "The above derivation is independent of the tangential, or in-plane velocities.  If the axial wind direction is reversed, nothing in the above derivation changes.  The positive thrust direction is still downwind, although because the \"downwind\" direction changes with a wind reversal, all of the thrust coefficients change sign if $V_x$ changes sign.  This is summarized in \\cref{sec:momsum}.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No Wind In One of the Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case where $V_x = 0$.  As shown later, there is no tangential induction, but there is still an axially induced velocity.  However, we can no longer use the normalization $a = u/V_x$, because $V_x = 0$.  Instead, we must use the full induced velocity $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two scenarios are possible (\\cref{fig:velocity-deficit2}).  No other scenario is possible, because the thrust and induction must be in opposite directions (see Kutta-Joukowski theorem and discussion in \\cref{sec:be}).  These cases are analogous to a helicopter in hover.\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "We do not nondimensionalize this thrust, because $V_x = 0$, but do need to consider the sign.  We define the positive convention for $u$, as consistent with our positive convention for $a$.  In other words, a positive $u$ is in the $-x$ direction.  Thus, our equation for thrust becomes:\n",

    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "If $V_y = 0$, then there is no axially induced velocity ($a = 0$), and $V_x$ passes through unchanged. Momentum theory predicts no thrust.  There is actually thrust, from the drag on the blades, but this arises from blade element theory and is treated later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Propellers\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing in the above derivation needs to be changed to handle propeller analysis.  The only physical change is that the propeller imparts energy to the fluid and so the induced velocity adds to the freestream velocity, rather than subtracts from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a conventional propeller derivation we would change the sign of the induced velocities, and change the conventional positive direction for thrust, and thus write the thrust coefficient as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    C_T = 4 a (1 + a) F\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "However, if we keep the conventions consistent we can use the exact same equations we have already derived.  If $a$ is negative that means the sign of the induced velocity has changed and is thus operating as a propeller.  Our existing expression for thrust coefficient \\cref{eq:CTmom2} gives then the correct result for a negative $a$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    C_T = - 4 a (1 + a) F\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Because we are keeping our positive convention as a positive thrust downwind, this correctly predicts the thrust as occurring upwind while in propeller operation.  In summary, we can use \\cref{eq:CTmom2} for either turbines or propellers.\n",
